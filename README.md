## üìù Project Overview

This project utilizes a diverse tech stack to ensure seamless integration and collaboration among services. Communication between services is managed by the [NATS Streaming Server](https://nats.io/), which decentralizes the communication infrastructure. Skaffold is used to automate the development environment and manage repetitive tasks.

### Services:

- **Authentication**: Manages all user login and signup functionalities.
- **Client**: Handles all front-end functionalities.
- **Tickets**: Manages CRUD operations for tickets.
- **Orders**: Oversees all functionalities related to ticket ordering and order status, including `pending`, `cancelled`, and `completed`.
- **Payments**: Manages payment processes, including canceling payments and updating other services upon successful transactions.
- **Expiration**: Locks tickets for 2 minutes upon purchase, after which the tickets are unlocked.
